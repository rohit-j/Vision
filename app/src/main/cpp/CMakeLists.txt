# Creates and names a library, sets it as either STATIC or SHARED, and provides the relative paths to its source code.
# You can define multiple libraries, and CMake builds them for you.
# Gradle automatically packages shared libraries with your APK.

# In this top level CMakeLists.txt, ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} is used to define the target library name; in the sub-module's CMakeLists.txt, ${PROJECT_NAME} is preferred for the same purpose.
# In order to load a library into your app from Java/Kotlin, you must call
# System.loadLibrary() and pass the name of the library defined here;
# for GameActivity/NativeActivity derived applications, the same library name must be
# used in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

# can link libraries from various origins, such as libraries defined in this
# build script, prebuilt third-party libraries, or Android system libraries.
